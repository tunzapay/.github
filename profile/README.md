# Tunza Pay

Welcome to the Tunza Pay GitHub organization! Tunza Pay is a web application built on a microservices architecture, utilizing API gateway, Docker, and Kubernetes. The goal is to provide a seamless platform for users to create contributions and facilitate payments through various methods. Currently, the application consists of core services such as Contribution Service, User Service, and Payment Service, but the aim is to expand gradually as the platform evolves.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tunza Pay, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repositories**: Clone the repositories of individual microservices from the Tunza Pay GitHub organization.
2. **Setup Environment**: Set up your development environment by installing necessary dependencies, Docker, and Kubernetes.
3. **Configuration**: Configure each microservice according to your environment settings. Refer to the README file in each repository for specific instructions.
4. **Run Services Locally**: Start each microservice locally for testing and development purposes. Make sure Docker and Kubernetes are running.

The architecture of Tunza Pay is designed to be scalable and resilient. Key components include:

- **Microservices**: Core functionalities are divided into separate microservices to promote modularity and independence.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology used to package each microservice with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration tool used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
